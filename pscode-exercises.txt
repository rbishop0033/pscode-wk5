// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 numbers together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

//check if number divisible by 2
//if TRUE, display Even
//if FALSE, display ODD

if num/2 == TRUE, print Even
OR print Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

//Enter five separate numbers
//Add all five numbers then divide by 5, display Average
//Determine lowest number, display Minimum
//Determine highest number, display Maximum
//Display Average (average of entered numbers), Minimum (lowest number), and Maximum (highest number)

input num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
Set average((num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)/5)
Print average

If (num1<num2)
	Set max to num2
Else
	Set max to num1
If (num3>max)
	Set max to num3
If (num4>max)
	Set max to num4
If (num5>max)
	Set max to num5
Print max


If (num1>num2)
	Set min to num2
Else
	Set min to num1
If (num3<min)
	Set min to num3
If (num4<min)
	Set min to num4
If (num5<min)
	Set min to num5
Print min


Print average (average of entered numbers), min (lowest number), and max (highest number)
